# Operating System Overview

An **Operating System (OS)** is software that acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and user applications. It manages hardware resources, provides a user interface, and enables the execution of programs.

## Kernel and Shell

- **Kernel**: 
  - The kernel is the core part of the OS that interacts directly with the hardware. It manages system resources like CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
  - **Working**: The kernel operates in a privileged mode and handles low-level tasks like scheduling processes and managing memory. It communicates with hardware through drivers.

- **Shell**: 
  - The shell is the interface that allows users to interact with the OS. It can be command-line based (like Bash) or graphical (like GNOME).
  - **Interaction**: When you type a command in the shell, it sends that command to the kernel, which executes it and returns the output to the shell.

## How Software Programs Interact with the OS

When you run a program:
1. The shell receives the command to execute the program.
2. It sends the command to the kernel.
3. The kernel loads the program into memory, allocates resources, and starts executing it.
4. The program can make requests to the OS (like accessing files or network) using system calls.

## Services of the OS

- **User Services**:
  - **User Interface**: Graphical or command-line interfaces for user interaction.
  - **File Management**: Creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.
  - **Process Management**: Handling execution of programs and multitasking.
  - **Device Management**: Controlling hardware devices (printers, disks).

- **System Services**:
  - **Security**: Protecting system resources and managing user permissions.
  - **Error Detection**: Monitoring for errors and handling them appropriately.
  - **Resource Allocation**: Distributing system resources among processes.

## Types of Operating Systems

1. **Batch OS**: Executes batches of jobs without user interaction.
2. **Time-Sharing OS**: Allows multiple users to access the system simultaneously.
3. **Distributed OS**: Manages a group of independent computers and makes them appear to users as a single coherent system.
4. **Embedded OS**: Designed for specific hardware, often found in devices like appliances or cars.
5. **Real-Time OS**: Guarantees specific response times for critical tasks.

## Functions of the OS

- **Process Management**: Scheduling and executing processes.
- **Memory Management**: Keeping track of each byte in a computer's memory.
- **File System Management**: Handling the storage, retrieval, naming, sharing, and protection of files.
- **Device Management**: Coordinating and controlling hardware devices.
- **Security Management**: Protecting data and resources from unauthorized access.

## What is a System Call?

A **System Call** is a way for programs to request services from the OS. It provides an interface between a running program and the OS. System calls enable user programs to perform operations like:

- **File Operations**: Opening, reading, writing, and closing files.
- **Process Control**: Creating and terminating processes.
- **Communication**: Sending and receiving data between processes.

### Types of System Calls

1. **File Manipulation**: Operations related to files.
2. **Process Control**: Creating, terminating, and waiting for processes.
3. **Device Management**: Interacting with hardware devices.
4. **Information Maintenance**: Getting or setting system information.
5. **Communication**: Managing communications between processes.


# Linux Overview
