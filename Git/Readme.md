# Git in DevOps
Git is an essential tool in DevOps for managing and tracking code changes. It enables collaboration, version control, and efficient code management, making it indispensable for DevOps engineers working in agile and CI/CD environments.

## Definition
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. It tracks changes in source code during software development, facilitating collaboration and ensuring code integrity.

- **Developed by**: Linus Torvalds
- **Purpose**: Track changes in source code during software development

## üß© **Types of Git Repositories**

### 1. **Local Repository**
   - The repository on your local machine where you work on files and commit changes.
   - **Commands**:
     ```bash
     git init             # Initialize a new local repository
     git add .            # Stage files for commit
     git commit -m "Your message"   # Commit changes
     ```

### 2. **Remote Repository**
   - A shared repository hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. 
   - Used to sync changes across different developers.
   - **Commands**:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin <repo_url>   # Link local repo to remote
     git push origin main                 # Push commits to remote main branch
     git pull origin main                 # Pull latest changes from remote main branch
     ```

## üåê **Public vs. Private Repositories**

| Type of Repo      | Description                                                                                     | Use Cases                                |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Public Repo**   | Accessible to anyone; ideal for open-source projects where transparency and collaboration are key. | Open-source projects, public knowledge sharing |
| **Private Repo**  | Access is restricted; only selected users can view or contribute. Suitable for proprietary code. | Internal projects, sensitive codebases  |

### **How to Create a Public/Private Repository on GitHub:**
1. Go to **GitHub** and click on **New Repository**.
2. Name your repository and choose **Public** or **Private**.
3. Initialize with a **README** if needed, and click **Create Repository**.

## How and Why Git is Used
- **Collaboration**: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without overwriting each other's changes.
- **Version Tracking**: Keeps a history of changes, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if necessary.
- **Branching and Merging**: Supports branching, enabling features to be developed in isolation and merged back into the main codebase.

## Basic Information
- **Commits**: Snapshots of changes made to files in a repository.
- **Branches**: Independent lines of development. The main branch is often called `main` or `master`.
- **Merges**: Combining changes from one branch into another.
- **Staging Area**: A place where changes are prepared before committing them to the repository.

## üîÑ **Why Use Git in DevOps?**

- **Version Control**: Maintains a history of changes, making it easy to revert if necessary.
- **Collaboration**: Allows multiple team members to work together on the same codebase.
- **Automation Integration**: Easily integrates with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI for automated testing and deployments.

| Sets the upstream branch for the current local branch, making future git push and git pull commands easier.           | `git push --set-upstream origin main`    |
| Unstages a file that has been added to staging area, moving it back to working directory(reverts a git add action).   | `git restore --staged <file_name>`       |
